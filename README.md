Here's an example of a README file for the Sudoku solver program:

---

# Sudoku Solver

This program solves a Sudoku puzzle. A valid Sudoku has only one possible solution.

## Usage

You can run the program using the following command:

```shell
$ go run . "<row1>" "<row2>" "<row3>" "<row4>" "<row5>" "<row6>" "<row7>" "<row8>" "<row9>" | cat -e
```

Each row of the Sudoku puzzle should be provided as an argument to the program, with a total of 9 arguments, each representing a row of the puzzle. The rows should be provided as strings containing 9 characters each. Empty cells can be represented by a dot (`.`).

### Example Usage:

```shell
$ go run . ".96.4...1" "1...6...4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7" | cat -e
3 9 6 2 4 5 7 8 1$
1 7 8 3 6 9 5 2 4$
5 2 4 8 1 7 3 9 6$
2 8 7 9 5 1 6 4 3$
9 3 1 4 8 6 2 7 5$
4 6 5 7 2 3 9 1 8$
7 1 2 6 3 8 4 5 9$
6 5 9 1 7 4 8 3 2$
8 4 3 5 9 2 1 6 7$
$
```

The output will be the solved Sudoku puzzle, where each row is printed on a new line and each number is separated by a space. The output ends with a `$` sign.

### Error Handling:

The program will display "Error$" for invalid inputs, including:

- Fewer than 9 rows provided as arguments.
- Rows containing characters other than numbers (1-9) and dots (`.`).
- Puzzles that are not solvable or have more than one solution.

Example error outputs:

```shell
$ go run . 1 2 3 4 | cat -e
Error$
$ go run . | cat -e
Error$
$ go run . ".96.4...1" "1...6.1.4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7" | cat -e
Error$
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.x or higher.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `main.go` file is located.
3. Run the program using the usage instructions mentioned above.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, ensure you are providing valid Sudoku puzzles as input.
- Check that each row contains exactly 9 characters.
- Verify the usage syntax and inputs according to the examples.
